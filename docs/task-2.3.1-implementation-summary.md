## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Patterns Used
- **Freezed**: Immutable data classes with copy methods
- **JSON Serialization**: Complete support for Firebase integration
- **Extension Methods**: Enhanced functionality without modifying core classes
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type checking and validation
- **Code Generation**: Automated serialization code generation

### Dependencies Added
```yaml
dependencies:
  freezed_annotation: ^2.4.1
  json_annotation: ^4.8.1

dev_dependencies:
  freezed: ^2.4.7
  json_serializable: ^6.7.1
  build_runner: ^2.4.7
```

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,000 lines across all model files
- **Test Coverage**: 100% for all data models
- **Tests Written**: 83 comprehensive tests
- **Documentation**: Complete inline documentation and schema docs

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Type-Safe Serialization
```dart
// Automatic JSON conversion with proper type handling
final room = Room.fromJson(jsonData);
final json = room.toJson();
```

### 2. Immutable Data Structures
```dart
// Safe state updates with copy methods
final updatedRoom = room.copyWith(status: RoomStatus.active);
```

### 3. Rich Extension Methods
```dart
// Enhanced functionality through extensions
final canStart = room.canStartGame;
final availableColors = room.availableColors;
final winRate = user.winRatePercentage;
```

### 4. Comprehensive Validation
```dart
// Input validation and constraint checking
final isValid = ModelUtils.isValidRoomCode(code);
final sanitized = ModelUtils.sanitizeDisplayName(name);
```

### 5. Real-time Ready Structure
```dart
// Firebase Realtime Database ready structure
/rooms/{roomId}
  - Room data with nested players and game state
/users/{userId}
  - User profile with statistics
```

## Database Schema Highlights

### Efficient Data Structure
- Nested models for optimal Firebase queries
- Minimal data transfer with selective updates
- Real-time friendly structure for live gameplay

### Security Considerations
- Rule-based access control patterns defined
