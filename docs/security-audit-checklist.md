### Room Security
- [x] Room read access requires participation or room doesn't exist
- [x] Room write access requires authentication
- [x] Player data isolation within rooms
- [x] Game state updates restricted to participants

## Functional Testing ✅

### Room Access Scenarios
- [x] Authenticated user can read room they're in
- [x] Authenticated user can read non-existent room (for joining)
- [x] Unauthenticated user cannot read rooms
- [x] Room participants can access room data
- [x] Non-participants cannot access room data

- [x] Game state access requires room participation

### User Data Security
- [x] Users can only access their own profiles
- [x] Cross-user data access is denied
- [x] User data isolation is enforced

## Security Threats Mitigation ✅

### Unauthorized Access

- [x] Cross-user data access prevented
- [x] Room data access restricted to participants

### Data Tampering
- [x] Players cannot modify other players' data
- [x] Game state changes restricted to participants
