# Task 1.3.3 Implementation Summary

## Completed Components

### 1. Score Management System ✅
**File**: `lib/features/game/models/score_manager.dart`
- Real-time score tracking with stream-based updates
- Food consumption scoring with snake length bonuses
- High score tracking and persistence
- Session management with game count tracking
- Comprehensive statistics and score calculation utilities

- `CompactGameStatusWidget`: Icon-only status indicators
- `GameStatusBar`: Compact status bar for minimal UI impact
- State-specific messaging for menu, playing, paused, game over, and restarting states

### 5. Game Controls UI ✅
**File**: `lib/features/game/widgets/game_controls_widget.dart`
- `GameControlsWidget`: Full control buttons with context-aware display
- `CompactGameControlsWidget`: Minimal control buttons for space-constrained UIs
- `FloatingGameControlsWidget`: Floating action button style controls
- State-based control visibility (pause/resume/restart/start)

## Integration with Game Controller ✅

### Updated GameController
- Integrated ScoreManager for centralized score handling
- Exposed stateManager and scoreManager getters for HUD access
- Updated food consumption to use ScoreManager with length-based bonuses
