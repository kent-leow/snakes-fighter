- **REQ-GM-003**: Collision Detection
  - **Priority**: Critical
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Snake dies when hitting walls
    - [ ] Snake dies when hitting own body
    - [ ] Snake dies when hitting other snakes

- **REQ-GM-004**: Win Conditions
  - **Priority**: Critical
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Last surviving player wins
    - [ ] Game ends when win condition met

### Authentication System
- **REQ-AU-001**: Simple Authentication
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Anonymous/Guest access
    - [ ] Optional Google Sign-In

### Room Management
- **REQ-RM-001**: Room Creation & Joining
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Create new game rooms
    - [ ] Join room by room code
    - [ ] Room capacity: 2-4 players
    - [ ] Players assigned unique colors

- **REQ-RM-002**: Game State Management
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Room states: waiting, active, ended
    - [ ] Host can start games
    - [ ] Auto-cleanup abandoned rooms

### Real-time Synchronization
- **REQ-RT-001**: Game State Sync
  - **Priority**: Critical
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Player movements synchronized
    - [ ] Food positions synchronized
    - [ ] Death events propagated immediately

### User Interface
- **REQ-UI-001**: Controls
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Swipe gestures (mobile)
    - [ ] Arrow keys (web)
    - [ ] Responsive layout

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Game maintains 60fps on mobile devices
- Network latency <200ms for multiplayer sync
- Memory usage <100MB on mobile

### Security
- Game moves validated server-side
- Room access controlled through Firebase rules
- User data sanitized

## Business Rules

- Snake cannot move backwards
- Room capacity: 2-4 players
- Host can start games
- Inactive rooms cleaned up after 30 minutes

## Data Requirements

### Core Entities
- **Player**: ID, color, position, direction, body segments, alive status
- **Room**: ID, host ID, state, player list
- **Food**: position coordinates
- **Game Settings**: max players, grid size

## Technical Stack

### Firebase Services
- Firebase Realtime Database (game state sync)
- Firebase Authentication (anonymous + Google)
- Firebase Hosting (web deployment)

### Development
- Flutter (cross-platform framework)
- Dart (programming language)

## Constraints

- Firebase free tier limitations
- Single developer project
- Cross-platform compatibility (Web + Mobile)
- No complex features for MVP
