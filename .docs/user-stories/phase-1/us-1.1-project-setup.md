# User Story 1.1: Setup Project Foundation

## Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** to set up the Flutter project structure and basic architecture  
**So that** I have a solid foundation to build the multiplayer snake game

## Business Context
- **Module**: Project Foundation
- **Phase**: Foundation & Core Game Engine
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Business Value**: Enables all subsequent development work
- **Related Requirements**: None (foundational)

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** Flutter SDK is installed **When** creating a new project **Then** project should compile without errors
- [ ] **Given** project structure is set up **When** running the app **Then** basic Flutter app should launch successfully
- [ ] **Given** project dependencies are configured **When** importing packages **Then** all required dependencies should resolve correctly
- [ ] **Given** development environment is ready **When** hot reload is triggered **Then** changes should appear immediately

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: Project build time <30 seconds for initial build
- [ ] Security: No sensitive credentials committed to repository
- [ ] Usability: Clear project structure following Flutter conventions

## Business Rules
- Follow Flutter best practices for project organization
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout the project
- Separate concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Flutter SDK: Required for cross-platform development
- Dart SDK: Programming language for Flutter
- Development IDE: VS Code or Android Studio

### Story Dependencies
- None (foundational story)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Flutter project created with proper structure
- [ ] Basic folder structure established (lib/, assets/, test/)
- [ ] Development environment configured
- [ ] Initial app builds and runs successfully
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility from the start
- Set up proper folder structure for scalability
- Configure development tools for efficient workflow

### Business Assumptions
- Developer has Flutter development experience
- Target platforms include Web, Android, and iOS

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 2
- **Estimated Hours**: 8-16 hours
- **Complexity**: Low
