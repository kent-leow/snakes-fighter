# User Story 1.3: Create Basic Game UI

## Story
**As a** player  
**I want** to see the game canvas with controls and basic information  
**So that** I can interact with the game and understand my current status

## Business Context
- **Module**: Basic Game UI
- **Phase**: Foundation & Core Game Engine
- **Priority**: High
- **Business Value**: Provides essential user interface for game interaction
- **Related Requirements**: REQ-UI-001

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** the game is launched **When** the main screen loads **Then** I should see a game canvas with clear boundaries
- [ ] **Given** I'm using a mobile device **When** I swipe on the screen **Then** the snake should change direction accordingly
- [ ] **Given** I'm using a web browser **When** I press arrow keys **Then** the snake should respond to keyboard input
- [ ] **Given** the game is running **When** I view the HUD **Then** I should see current score/length
- [ ] **Given** different screen sizes **When** the game loads **Then** the layout should adapt responsively
- [ ] **Given** the game is active **When** viewing the screen **Then** game elements should be clearly visible and distinguishable

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: UI renders at 60fps consistently
- [ ] Usability: Touch targets are at least 44px for mobile accessibility
- [ ] Usability: Visual feedback for all user interactions
- [ ] Responsiveness: Layout adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

## Business Rules
- Mobile devices use swipe gestures for controls
- Web platforms use arrow keys as primary control method
- Game canvas maintains aspect ratio across devices
- HUD displays essential game information without cluttering the screen

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Flutter Widget Framework: For UI rendering
- Gesture Detection: For mobile swipe controls
- Keyboard Input: For web controls

### Story Dependencies
- US 1.1: Project foundation required
- US 1.2: Game engine needed for UI integration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Game canvas renders correctly
- [ ] Mobile swipe controls functional
- [ ] Web keyboard controls functional
- [ ] Basic HUD displaying game information
- [ ] Responsive design working on different screen sizes
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Use Flutter's CustomPainter for efficient game rendering
- Implement proper touch event handling for mobile
- Consider using MediaQuery for responsive design
- Optimize for different pixel densities

### Business Assumptions
- Users are familiar with standard swipe gestures
- Arrow key controls are intuitive for web users
- Minimal UI is preferred for better gameplay focus

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Estimated Hours**: 24-40 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
