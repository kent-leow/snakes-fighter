# User Story 2.3: Design Database Schema

## Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** to create a well-structured database schema for rooms, players, and game state  
**So that** multiplayer game data can be efficiently stored and synchronized

## Business Context
- **Module**: Database Schema
- **Phase**: Firebase Integration & Authentication
- **Priority**: High
- **Business Value**: Provides the data foundation for multiplayer functionality
- **Related Requirements**: REQ-RM-001, REQ-RM-002

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** the database schema **When** a room is created **Then** room data should be properly structured and stored
- [ ] **Given** a player joins a room **When** player data is added **Then** player information should be correctly associated with the room
- [ ] **Given** game state changes **When** updates occur **Then** all relevant data should be consistently synchronized
- [ ] **Given** the database structure **When** queried **Then** data retrieval should be efficient and performant
- [ ] **Given** room lifecycle **When** games end **Then** cleanup processes should maintain database efficiency

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: Database reads complete within 100ms
- [ ] Scalability: Schema supports multiple concurrent rooms
- [ ] Security: Database security rules prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Maintainability: Clear data relationships and naming conventions

## Business Rules
- Each room has a unique identifier and room code
- Players are uniquely identified within each room
- Game state includes all necessary information for synchronization
- Room capacity is limited to 2-4 players
- Inactive rooms are automatically cleaned up

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Firebase Realtime Database: For data storage
- Database Security Rules: For access control
- Data Models: For type safety and validation

### Story Dependencies
- US 2.1: Firebase configuration required
- US 2.2: Authentication system needed for user identification

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Database schema designed and documented
- [ ] Data models created with proper typing
- [ ] Firebase security rules implemented
- [ ] Database structure tested with sample data
- [ ] Indexing configured for optimal performance
- [ ] Cleanup mechanisms for abandoned rooms
- [ ] Documentation updated with schema details
- [ ] Security rules tested and validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Use denormalized data structure for real-time performance
- Implement proper indexing for frequently queried data
- Consider data size limitations for real-time synchronization
- Plan for eventual consistency in distributed scenarios

### Business Assumptions
- Real-time database is more suitable than Firestore for game state
- Room-based data isolation is sufficient for security
- Player data can be ephemeral per game session

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Estimated Hours**: 16-24 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
