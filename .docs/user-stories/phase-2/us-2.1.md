# User Story 2.1: Configure Firebase Services

## Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** to set up Firebase project with necessary services configured  
**So that** I can integrate authentication, database, and hosting for the multiplayer game

## Business Context
- **Module**: Firebase Configuration
- **Phase**: Firebase Integration & Authentication
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Business Value**: Enables all multiplayer and cloud-based features
- **Related Requirements**: None (foundational)

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** a new Firebase project **When** services are configured **Then** Firebase Realtime Database should be accessible
- [ ] **Given** Firebase setup is complete **When** authentication is enabled **Then** anonymous and Google Sign-In should be available
- [ ] **Given** Cloud Functions are deployed **When** triggered **Then** they should execute successfully
- [ ] **Given** Firebase configuration **When** integrated with Flutter **Then** app should connect without errors
- [ ] **Given** security rules are set **When** database access is attempted **Then** proper access control should be enforced

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Security: Firebase security rules properly configured
- [ ] Performance: Firebase connection established <2 seconds
- [ ] Scalability: Configuration supports Firebase free tier limits
- [ ] Reliability: Fallback mechanisms for connection failures

## Business Rules
- Use Firebase free tier to minimize costs
- Implement proper security rules from the start
- Configure separate environments for development and production
- Monitor usage to stay within free tier limits

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Firebase Project: Google Cloud Platform account required
- Flutter Firebase Plugins: For Flutter integration
- Node.js: For Cloud Functions development

### Story Dependencies
- US 1.1: Project foundation must be established

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Firebase project created and configured
- [ ] Firebase Realtime Database enabled with security rules
- [ ] Firebase Authentication enabled with providers
- [ ] Firebase Cloud Functions project initialized
- [ ] Firebase Hosting configured
- [ ] Flutter app successfully connects to Firebase
- [ ] Environment variables and configuration secured
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Security rules tested and validated

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Set up proper environment separation (dev/prod)
- Configure Firebase CLI for deployment
- Implement proper error handling for Firebase operations
- Monitor Firebase usage to prevent exceeding free tier

### Business Assumptions
- Firebase free tier is sufficient for initial development and testing
- Google account access is available for Firebase setup
- Real-time database is preferred over Firestore for game state

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Estimated Hours**: 16-24 hours
- **Complexity**: Low
