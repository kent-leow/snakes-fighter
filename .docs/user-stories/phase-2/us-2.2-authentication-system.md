# User Story 2.2: Implement Authentication System

## Story
**As a** player  
**I want** to sign in anonymously or with Google account  
**So that** I can join multiplayer games and have my identity recognized

## Business Context
- **Module**: Authentication System
- **Phase**: Firebase Integration & Authentication
- **Priority**: High
- **Business Value**: Enables user identification for multiplayer gameplay
- **Related Requirements**: REQ-AU-001

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** the app is launched **When** I choose anonymous sign-in **Then** I should be authenticated and able to join games
- [ ] **Given** the authentication screen **When** I select Google Sign-In **Then** I should be prompted for Google account credentials
- [ ] **Given** successful Google Sign-In **When** authentication completes **Then** my display name and profile should be available
- [ ] **Given** I'm authenticated **When** I close and reopen the app **Then** my session should persist
- [ ] **Given** authentication fails **When** error occurs **Then** I should see a clear error message and retry option
- [ ] **Given** I'm signed in **When** I choose to sign out **Then** I should be logged out and returned to authentication screen

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: Authentication completes within 5 seconds
- [ ] Security: User tokens are securely stored and managed
- [ ] Usability: Clear authentication flow with progress indicators
- [ ] Reliability: Graceful handling of network connectivity issues

## Business Rules
- Anonymous users get temporary unique identifiers
- Google Sign-In users retain their display names
- Authentication state persists across app sessions
- Users can switch between anonymous and Google authentication
- No personal data is required for game participation

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Firebase Authentication: For user management
- Google Sign-In Plugin: For Google authentication
- Secure Storage: For token persistence

### Story Dependencies
- US 2.1: Firebase configuration must be complete

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Anonymous authentication functional
- [ ] Google Sign-In integration working
- [ ] Authentication state management implemented
- [ ] Error handling for authentication failures
- [ ] Session persistence working correctly
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Use Firebase Auth SDK for Flutter
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- Handle authentication state changes throughout the app
- Consider offline authentication scenarios

### Business Assumptions
- Users prefer quick anonymous access over mandatory registration
- Google Sign-In provides sufficient social authentication
- No email verification is required for game access

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Estimated Hours**: 24-32 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
