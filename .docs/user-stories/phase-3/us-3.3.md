# User Story 3.3: Create Multiplayer Game Loop

## Story
**As a** player  
**I want** to play competitive snake games with multiple players where the last survivor wins  
**So that** I can enjoy challenging multiplayer gameplay

## Business Context
- **Module**: Multiplayer Game Loop
- **Phase**: Multiplayer Foundation
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Business Value**: Delivers the core competitive multiplayer gaming experience
- **Related Requirements**: REQ-GM-004

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** multiple players are in a room **When** the host starts the game **Then** all players should see the game begin simultaneously
- [ ] **Given** the game is active **When** players control their snakes **Then** each player should only control their own snake
- [ ] **Given** snakes are moving **When** collisions occur **Then** affected snakes should die and be removed from play
- [ ] **Given** only one player remains alive **When** all others have died **Then** that player should be declared the winner
- [ ] **Given** all players die simultaneously **When** collision occurs **Then** the game should declare a draw
- [ ] **Given** the game ends **When** win conditions are met **Then** all players should see the results screen

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: Game runs smoothly at 60fps for all players
- [ ] Performance: Game logic processing completes within 16ms per frame
- [ ] Fairness: All players have equal game conditions and timing
- [ ] Reliability: Game state remains consistent across all clients

## Business Rules
- Only the room host can start the game
- Game begins when all players are ready and host initiates
- Last surviving player wins the match
- Players cannot control other players' snakes
- Game ends immediately when win condition is met
- All players must see identical game state

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Firebase Cloud Functions: For server-side game logic validation
- Game Engine: For multiplayer game mechanics
- Real-time Synchronization: For consistent game state

### Story Dependencies
- US 3.1: Room management system required
- US 3.2: Real-time synchronization needed
- US 1.2: Core game engine must be multiplayer-ready

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Multi-player game initiation working
- [ ] Individual player controls functional
- [ ] Win condition detection implemented
- [ ] Game end scenarios handled correctly
- [ ] Results display for all players
- [ ] Server-side validation for fair play
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Integration tests with multiple players
- [ ] Cross-platform multiplayer testing completed

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Implement server-side validation to prevent cheating
- Use deterministic game logic for consistent results
- Handle edge cases like simultaneous deaths
- Optimize network communication for real-time gameplay

### Business Assumptions
- Players understand competitive last-survivor gameplay
- Game sessions are short enough to maintain engagement
- Simple win conditions are sufficient for MVP

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Estimated Hours**: 32-48 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
