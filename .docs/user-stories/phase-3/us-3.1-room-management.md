# User Story 3.1: Build Room Management System

## Story
**As a** player  
**I want** to create or join game rooms with other players  
**So that** I can participate in multiplayer snake games

## Business Context
- **Module**: Room System
- **Phase**: Multiplayer Foundation
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Business Value**: Enables core multiplayer functionality and player matchmaking
- **Related Requirements**: REQ-RM-001, REQ-RM-002

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** I'm authenticated **When** I create a new room **Then** I should become the room host with a unique room code
- [ ] **Given** a room code exists **When** I enter it to join **Then** I should be added to that room if space is available
- [ ] **Given** I'm in a room **When** other players join **Then** I should see their names and assigned colors
- [ ] **Given** I'm the room host **When** 2-4 players are present **Then** I should be able to start the game
- [ ] **Given** a room is full **When** someone tries to join **Then** they should receive a "room full" message
- [ ] **Given** a room is in progress **When** someone tries to join **Then** they should be informed the game has started
- [ ] **Given** players leave the room **When** the host leaves **Then** host privileges should transfer to another player

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: Room operations complete within 2 seconds
- [ ] Scalability: System supports multiple concurrent rooms
- [ ] Reliability: Room state remains consistent across all clients
- [ ] Usability: Clear feedback for all room operations

## Business Rules
- Room capacity is 2-4 players maximum
- Each room has a unique 6-character room code
- Room host has privileges to start the game
- Players are assigned unique colors automatically
- Inactive rooms are cleaned up after 30 minutes
- Only authenticated users can create or join rooms

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Firebase Realtime Database: For room state management
- Firebase Cloud Functions: For room validation and cleanup
- Authentication System: For player identification

### Story Dependencies
- US 2.1: Firebase configuration required
- US 2.2: Authentication system needed
- US 2.3: Database schema must be implemented

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Room creation functionality working
- [ ] Room joining with codes functional
- [ ] Player management within rooms
- [ ] Host privileges and game starting
- [ ] Room state synchronization across clients
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Room cleanup mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Integration tests with multiple clients
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Use transactions for atomic room operations
- Implement proper error handling for network issues
- Consider race conditions when multiple players join simultaneously
- Optimize for real-time updates without excessive data transfer

### Business Assumptions
- 6-character room codes provide sufficient uniqueness
- Players are comfortable with room code sharing for private games
- Host migration is acceptable when original host leaves

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 13
- **Estimated Hours**: 60-80 hours
- **Complexity**: High
