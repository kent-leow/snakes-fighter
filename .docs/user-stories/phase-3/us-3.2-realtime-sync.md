# User Story 3.2: Implement Real-time Game Synchronization

## Story
**As a** player  
**I want** all game events to be synchronized in real-time across all players  
**So that** everyone sees the same game state and can compete fairly

## Business Context
- **Module**: Real-time Synchronization
- **Phase**: Multiplayer Foundation
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Business Value**: Ensures fair and consistent multiplayer gameplay experience
- **Related Requirements**: REQ-RT-001

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** multiple players in a game **When** any player moves **Then** all players should see the movement immediately
- [ ] **Given** a player consumes food **When** the collision occurs **Then** all players should see the snake grow and food disappear
- [ ] **Given** a snake dies **When** collision is detected **Then** all players should see the death animation and updated game state
- [ ] **Given** food is consumed **When** new food spawns **Then** all players should see the food in the same location
- [ ] **Given** network interruption **When** connection is restored **Then** game state should resynchronize correctly
- [ ] **Given** high latency conditions **When** events occur **Then** game should handle synchronization gracefully

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: Game events synchronized within 200ms across all clients
- [ ] Performance: Network bandwidth usage optimized for mobile connections
- [ ] Reliability: Game state remains consistent despite network issues
- [ ] Scalability: Synchronization works with 2-4 players efficiently

## Business Rules
- All game-affecting events must be synchronized
- Server-side validation prevents cheating through client manipulation
- Game state is the authoritative source of truth
- Lag compensation mechanisms ensure fair gameplay
- Network failures trigger appropriate reconnection attempts

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Firebase Realtime Database: For real-time data synchronization
- WebSocket Connections: For low-latency communication
- Conflict Resolution: For handling simultaneous events

### Story Dependencies
- US 3.1: Room management system required
- US 1.2: Core game engine needed for game events
- US 2.3: Database schema must support real-time updates

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Player movement synchronization working
- [ ] Food spawn/consumption synchronization functional
- [ ] Death events properly propagated
- [ ] Network error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<200ms latency)
- [ ] Integration tests with multiple clients
- [ ] Load testing with maximum players
- [ ] Cross-platform synchronization verified

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Use Firebase Realtime Database listeners for instant updates
- Implement delta updates to minimize bandwidth usage
- Consider using timestamps for event ordering
- Handle client-side prediction and server reconciliation

### Business Assumptions
- 200ms latency is acceptable for multiplayer snake gameplay
- Players have reasonably stable internet connections
- Mobile data usage is a concern for players

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Estimated Hours**: 40-56 hours
- **Complexity**: High
