# User Story 5.2: Deploy and Distribute Application

## Story
**As a** end user  
**I want** to access the multiplayer snake game through web browsers and mobile app stores  
**So that** I can easily download and play the game on my preferred device

## Business Context
- **Module**: Deployment & Distribution
- **Phase**: Deployment & Launch
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Business Value**: Makes the game available to end users across all target platforms
- **Related Requirements**: None (deployment focused)

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** the web version **When** I visit the game URL **Then** I should be able to play the full game in my browser
- [ ] **Given** mobile app builds **When** deployed to app stores **Then** users should be able to download and install the game
- [ ] **Given** different platforms **When** I play the game **Then** functionality should be identical across web and mobile
- [ ] **Given** app updates **When** new versions are released **Then** users should be notified and able to update easily
- [ ] **Given** the deployed application **When** users access it **Then** all features should work as expected in production
- [ ] **Given** various devices **When** users play **Then** performance should meet the established benchmarks

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Availability: Web version accessible 99.9% of the time
- [ ] Performance: App download and installation complete within reasonable time
- [ ] Compatibility: Works on all specified minimum device requirements
- [ ] Usability: Simple and clear installation/access process for users

## Business Rules
- Web version must be accessible via HTTPS with custom domain
- Mobile apps must meet app store requirements and guidelines
- All platforms must have consistent feature parity
- Update mechanisms must be reliable and user-friendly
- Distribution should reach target audiences effectively

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Firebase Hosting: For web deployment
- App Store Accounts: For mobile distribution
- Build Pipeline: For automated deployments

### Story Dependencies
- US 5.1: Production environment must be ready
- US 4.3: Testing must be complete
- All feature stories: Complete application required

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Web version deployed to Firebase Hosting with custom domain
- [ ] Android app built and uploaded to Google Play Store
- [ ] iOS app built and submitted to Apple App Store
- [ ] Deployment pipeline configured for future updates
- [ ] App store listings created with descriptions and screenshots
- [ ] Cross-platform functionality verified in production
- [ ] Performance validated on production environment
- [ ] User download/access documentation created
- [ ] Analytics and tracking configured for launch metrics
- [ ] Launch announcement materials prepared
- [ ] Post-launch support procedures established

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Use Flutter web for browser deployment
- Configure proper build settings for each platform
- Implement proper analytics tracking for launch metrics
- Set up continuous deployment for future updates

### Business Assumptions
- App store approval process will complete within reasonable timeframes
- Users prefer multiple access options (web and mobile)
- Cross-platform consistency is important for user experience

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 8
- **Estimated Hours**: 24-32 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
