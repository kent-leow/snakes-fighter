# User Story 5.1: Setup Production Environment

## Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** to configure a production-ready Firebase environment with proper security and monitoring  
**So that** the game can be deployed safely and reliably for end users

## Business Context
- **Module**: Production Environment
- **Phase**: Deployment & Launch
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Business Value**: Enables secure and scalable production deployment
- **Related Requirements**: NFR-SEC-002, NFR-SCAL-001

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Given** production requirements **When** Firebase environment is configured **Then** all services should be properly secured for production use
- [ ] **Given** production deployment **When** security rules are applied **Then** unauthorized access should be prevented
- [ ] **Given** monitoring setup **When** production issues occur **Then** alerts should be generated for critical problems
- [ ] **Given** backup systems **When** configured **Then** data should be protected against loss
- [ ] **Given** environment separation **When** production is deployed **Then** it should be isolated from development environment
- [ ] **Given** performance monitoring **When** production is active **Then** system performance should be tracked and reported

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Security: Production environment hardened against common attacks
- [ ] Reliability: 99.9% uptime target with proper monitoring
- [ ] Scalability: Configuration supports expected user load
- [ ] Maintainability: Clear deployment and rollback procedures

## Business Rules
- Production environment must be completely separate from development
- All security best practices must be implemented
- Monitoring and alerting must be configured before launch
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures must be established
- Resource usage must stay within Firebase free tier limits initially

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Firebase Production Project: Separate from development
- Monitoring Tools: For system health tracking
- Security Configuration: Production-grade security rules

### Story Dependencies
- US 2.1: Firebase development setup for reference configuration
- US 4.2: Security requirements and implementations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Production Firebase project created and configured
- [ ] Production-grade security rules implemented and tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting systems configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures established
- [ ] Environment variables and secrets management configured
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates configured for custom domains
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboards created
- [ ] Security audit of production configuration completed
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented
- [ ] Production deployment checklist created

## Notes
### Technical Considerations
- Use Firebase project aliases for environment management
- Implement proper secret management for API keys
- Configure appropriate CORS policies for web deployment
- Set up proper logging and error tracking

### Business Assumptions
- Initial launch will use Firebase free tier with plans to upgrade if needed
- Production security requirements are higher than development
- Monitoring is essential for maintaining service quality

## Estimated Effort
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Estimated Hours**: 16-24 hours
- **Complexity**: Low
