# Task 3.1.2: Room Joining and Player Management

## Overview
- User Story: us-3.1-room-management
- Task ID: task-3.1.2-room-joining-player-management
- Priority: Critical
- Effort: 14 hours
- Dependencies: task-3.1.1-room-creation-code-generation

## Description
Implement room joining functionality using room codes, player management within rooms, and real-time player updates. Handle room capacity limits, player color assignment, and connection status tracking.

## Technical Requirements
### Components
- Room Joining Service: Join room by code logic

- Real-time Updates: Player status synchronization
- UI Components: Room joining interface and player list

### Tech Stack
- Firebase Realtime Database: Real-time player updates
- flutter_riverpod: State management
- Stream Subscriptions: Real-time data listening
- Custom Validators: Room code validation

## Implementation Steps
### Step 1: Implement Room Joining Service
- Action: Create service for joining rooms by code
- Deliverable: Room joining logic with validation
- Acceptance: Players can join rooms using valid codes
- Files: Updated `room_service.dart` with joining methods

### Step 2: Build Player Management System
- Action: Implement player add/remove and color assignment
- Deliverable: Complete player management functionality
- Acceptance: Players properly managed within rooms
- Files: `lib/features/room/services/player_management_service.dart`

### Step 3: Create Room Joining UI
- Action: Build user interface for entering room codes
- Deliverable: Room joining screen with code input
- Acceptance: Users can join rooms through UI
- Files: `lib/features/room/presentation/join_room_screen.dart`

### Step 4: Implement Real-time Player Updates
- Action: Add real-time synchronization for player changes
- Deliverable: Live player list updates
- Acceptance: Player changes appear instantly across all clients
- Files: Real-time providers and UI updates

## Technical Specs
### Room Joining Service
```dart
extension RoomServiceJoining on RoomService {
  Future<Room> joinRoom(String roomCode) async {
    final user = _authService.currentUser;
    if (user == null) {
      throw RoomException('User must be authenticated to join room');
    }
    
    final room = await _databaseService.getRoomByCode(roomCode);
    if (room == null) {
      throw RoomException('Room not found with code: $roomCode');
    }
    
    if (room.status != RoomStatus.waiting) {
      throw RoomException('Room is not accepting new players');
    }
    
    if (room.players.length >= room.maxPlayers) {
      throw RoomException('Room is full');
    }
    
    if (room.players.containsKey(user.uid)) {
      throw RoomException('You are already in this room');
    }
    
    final availableColor = _getAvailableColor(room.players.values.toList());
    final player = Player(
      uid: user.uid,
      displayName: user.displayName ?? 'Anonymous',
      color: availableColor,
      joinedAt: DateTime.now(),
      isReady: false,
    );
    
    await _databaseService.addPlayerToRoom(room.id, player);
    
    return room.copyWith(
      players: {...room.players, user.uid: player},
    );
  }
  
  PlayerColor _getAvailableColor(List<Player> existingPlayers) {
    final usedColors = existingPlayers.map((p) => p.color).toSet();
    
    for (final color in PlayerColor.values) {
      if (!usedColors.contains(color)) {
        return color;
      }
    }
    
    // Fallback to red if all colors used (shouldn't happen with max 4 players)
    return PlayerColor.red;
  }
  
  Future<void> leaveRoom(String roomId) async {
    final user = _authService.currentUser;
    if (user == null) return;
    
    await _databaseService.removePlayerFromRoom(roomId, user.uid);
  }
}
```

### Player Management Service
```dart
class PlayerManagementService {
  final DatabaseService _databaseService;
  
  PlayerManagementService(this._databaseService);
  
  Future<void> updatePlayerReady(String roomId, String playerId, bool isReady) async {
    final room = await _databaseService.getRoomById(roomId);
    if (room == null) throw RoomException('Room not found');
    
    final player = room.players[playerId];
    if (player == null) throw RoomException('Player not found in room');
    
    final updatedPlayer = player.copyWith(isReady: isReady);
    await _databaseService.updatePlayer(roomId, updatedPlayer);
  }
  
  Future<void> updatePlayerConnection(String roomId, String playerId, bool isConnected) async {
    final room = await _databaseService.getRoomById(roomId);
    if (room == null) return;
    
    final player = room.players[playerId];
    if (player == null) return;
    
    final updatedPlayer = player.copyWith(isConnected: isConnected);
    await _databaseService.updatePlayer(roomId, updatedPlayer);
  }
  
  Future<bool> canStartGame(String roomId) async {
    final room = await _databaseService.getRoomById(roomId);
    if (room == null) return false;
    
    final connectedPlayers = room.players.values
        .where((p) => p.isConnected)
        .toList();
    
    return connectedPlayers.length >= 2 && 
           connectedPlayers.every((p) => p.isReady);
  }
}
```

### Room State Provider
```dart
final currentRoomProvider = StateNotifierProvider<CurrentRoomNotifier, CurrentRoomState>((ref) {
  return CurrentRoomNotifier(
    ref.read(databaseServiceProvider),
    ref.read(roomServiceProvider),
  );
});

class CurrentRoomState {
  final Room? room;
  final bool isLoading;
  final String? error;
  final bool isHost;
  
  const CurrentRoomState({
    this.room,
    this.isLoading = false,
    this.error,
    this.isHost = false,
  });
}

class CurrentRoomNotifier extends StateNotifier<CurrentRoomState> {
  final DatabaseService _databaseService;
  final RoomService _roomService;
  StreamSubscription<Room?>? _roomSubscription;
  
  CurrentRoomNotifier(this._databaseService, this._roomService) 
      : super(const CurrentRoomState());
  
  Future<void> joinRoom(String roomCode) async {
    state = state.copyWith(isLoading: true, error: null);
    
    try {
      final room = await _roomService.joinRoom(roomCode);
      _subscribeToRoom(room.id);
    } catch (e) {
      state = state.copyWith(isLoading: false, error: e.toString());
    }
  }
  
  void _subscribeToRoom(String roomId) {
    _roomSubscription = _databaseService.watchRoom(roomId).listen(
      (room) {
        if (room != null) {
          final user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
          state = state.copyWith(
            room: room,
            isLoading: false,
            isHost: user?.uid == room.hostId,
          );
        }
      },
      onError: (error) {
        state = state.copyWith(
          isLoading: false,
          error: error.toString(),
        );
      },
    );
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _roomSubscription?.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```
