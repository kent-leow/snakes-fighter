      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(js|css|woff2|woff|ttf|eot)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "max-age=31536000"

### Version Management
```dart
// lib/core/app_info.dart
class AppInfo {
  static const String version = '1.0.0';
  static const int buildNumber = 1;
  static const String environment = String.fromEnvironment(
    'ENVIRONMENT',
    defaultValue: 'development',
  );
  
  static const String firebaseProjectId = String.fromEnvironment(
    'FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID',
    defaultValue: 'snakes-fight-dev',
  );
  
  static bool get isProduction => environment == 'production';
  static bool get isDevelopment => environment == 'development';
  
  static String get displayVersion => '$version ($buildNumber)';
}
```
