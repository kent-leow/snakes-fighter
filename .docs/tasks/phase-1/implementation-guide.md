### Code Organization
- Follow the defined folder structure
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Document complex logic

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Create widget tests for UI components
- Implement integration tests for system interactions
- Test on all target platforms regularly

### Performance Monitoring
- Profile game performance regularly
- Monitor memory usage on mobile devices
- Ensure consistent 60fps frame rate
- Optimize rendering and game loop

### Quality Assurance
- Use consistent code formatting
- Follow Flutter best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate all user inputs

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Performance Issues
- **Problem**: Frame rate drops on mobile
- **Solution**: Optimize rendering, use efficient data structures, profile regularly

### Input Lag
- **Problem**: Delayed response to user input
- **Solution**: Separate input handling from rendering, use stream-based architecture

### Memory Leaks
- **Problem**: Memory usage increases over time
- **Solution**: Proper cleanup in dispose methods, avoid retaining references

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Problem**: Inconsistent behavior across platforms
- **Solution**: Test on all platforms, use platform-adaptive code patterns
