# Task 1.3.1: Create Game Canvas and Rendering System

## Task Overview
- **User Story**: us-1.3-basic-game-ui
- **Task ID**: task-1.3.1-create-game-canvas-rendering-system
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 16 hours
- **Dependencies**: task-1.2.4-create-complete-game-loop

## Description
Create the visual game canvas using Flutter's CustomPainter for efficient rendering of the snake, food, and game grid. Implement responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining proper aspect ratio.

## Technical Requirements
### Architecture Components
- **Frontend**: Custom rendering system, responsive UI layout
- **Backend**: None (UI rendering)
- **Database**: None (UI state)
- **Integration**: Integration with game controller and state management

### Technology Stack
- **Language/Framework**: Flutter CustomPainter, Canvas API
- **Dependencies**: Flutter material design
- **Tools**: Flutter rendering pipeline

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Game Canvas Widget - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Implement CustomPainter-based game canvas for efficient rendering
- **Deliverable**: Game canvas widget that can render game elements
- **Acceptance**: Canvas renders consistently at 60fps with smooth animations
- **Files**: lib/features/game/widgets/game_canvas.dart

### Step 2: Implement Snake Rendering - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Create visual representation of snake with body segments and head
- **Deliverable**: Snake rendering with distinct head and body segments
- **Acceptance**: Snake is clearly visible and distinguishable from other elements
- **Files**: lib/features/game/rendering/snake_renderer.dart

### Step 3: Implement Food Rendering - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Create visual representation of food items
- **Deliverable**: Food rendering with clear visual distinction from snake
- **Acceptance**: Food is easily identifiable and visually appealing
- **Files**: lib/features/game/rendering/food_renderer.dart

### Step 4: Create Grid System Rendering - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Optional grid lines or background to help with game navigation
- **Deliverable**: Grid background rendering that doesn't interfere with gameplay
- **Acceptance**: Grid provides visual reference without cluttering the interface
- **Files**: lib/features/game/rendering/grid_renderer.dart

### Step 5: Implement Responsive Layout - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Make game canvas responsive to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Deliverable**: Responsive game canvas that maintains aspect ratio
- **Acceptance**: Game looks good on mobile phones, tablets, and web browsers
- **Files**: lib/features/game/widgets/responsive_game_container.dart

## Technical Specifications
### Game Canvas
```dart
class GameCanvas extends StatefulWidget {
  final GameController gameController;
  final Size gameSize;
  
  @override
  _GameCanvasState createState() => _GameCanvasState();
}

class GameCanvasPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final Snake snake;
  final List<Food> foods;
  final GameState gameState;
  
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size);
  
  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(GameCanvasPainter oldDelegate);
}
```

### Snake Renderer
```dart
class SnakeRenderer {
  static void renderSnake(Canvas canvas, Snake snake, Size canvasSize);
  static void renderSnakeHead(Canvas canvas, Position head, Size cellSize);
  static void renderSnakeBody(Canvas canvas, List<Position> body, Size cellSize);
}
```

### Responsive Container
```dart
class ResponsiveGameContainer extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LayoutBuilder(
      builder: (context, constraints) {
        return _buildResponsiveContainer(constraints);
      },
    );
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
### Task Dependencies
- **Before**: task-1.2.4-create-complete-game-loop
- **After**: task-1.3.2-implement-input-controls, task-1.3.3-create-game-hud

### External Dependencies
- **Services**: Flutter CustomPainter and Canvas APIs
- **Infrastructure**: Game controller and state management from previous tasks

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Rendering performance issues on lower-end devices
- **Mitigation**: Optimize rendering algorithms and test on target devices ✅ MITIGATED

- **Risk**: Visual elements not scaling properly on different screen sizes
- **Mitigation**: Implement thorough responsive design testing ✅ MITIGATED
