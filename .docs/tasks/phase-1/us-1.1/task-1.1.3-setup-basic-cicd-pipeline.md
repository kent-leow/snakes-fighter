# Task 1.1.3: Setup Basic CI/CD Pipeline

## Task Overview
- **User Story**: us-1.1-project-setup
- **Task ID**: task-1.1.3-setup-basic-cicd-pipeline
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 6 hours
- **Dependencies**: task-1.1.1-initialize-flutter-project, task-1.1.2-configure-development-environment

## Description
Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing, code quality checks, and build validation across multiple platforms. This ensures code quality and prevents regressions throughout development.

## Technical Requirements
### Architecture Components
- **Frontend**: Build automation for Flutter app
- **Backend**: None (CI/CD infrastructure)
- **Database**: None (CI/CD setup)
- **Integration**: GitHub Actions integration

### Technology Stack
- **Language/Framework**: GitHub Actions YAML, Flutter CLI
- **Dependencies**: GitHub repository, Flutter test framework
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, Flutter build tools

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Actions Workflow Structure
- **Action**: Set up .github/workflows directory with basic Flutter workflow
- **Deliverable**: GitHub Actions workflow file for Flutter CI
- **Acceptance**: Workflow triggers on push and pull requests
- **Files**: .github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml

### Step 2: Configure Automated Testing
- **Action**: Set up automated unit and widget testing in CI pipeline
- **Deliverable**: Test automation that runs on every commit
- **Acceptance**: All tests must pass before merge
- **Files**: .github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml (test steps)

### Step 3: Add Code Quality Checks
- **Action**: Integrate Flutter analyzer and formatting checks
- **Deliverable**: Automated code quality validation
- **Acceptance**: Code must pass linting and formatting checks
- **Files**: .github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml (quality steps)

### Step 4: Setup Multi-Platform Build Validation
- **Action**: Configure builds for web, Android, and iOS platforms
- **Deliverable**: Multi-platform build validation
- **Acceptance**: All target platforms build successfully
- **Files**: .github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml (build matrix)

### Step 5: Configure Build Artifacts and Caching
- **Action**: Set up dependency caching and build artifact storage
- **Deliverable**: Optimized CI pipeline with caching
- **Acceptance**: CI runs complete in under 10 minutes
- **Files**: .github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml (caching config)

## Technical Specifications
### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Flutter CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.19.0'
          channel: 'stable'
      - name: Get dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
      - name: Verify formatting
        run: dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
      - name: Analyze project source
        run: flutter analyze
      - name: Run tests
        run: flutter test

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    strategy:
      matrix:
        platform: [web, android]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.19.0'
          channel: 'stable'
      - name: Get dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
      - name: Build for ${{ matrix.platform }}
        run: flutter build ${{ matrix.platform }}
```

### Branch Protection Rules
```yaml
# Recommended GitHub branch protection settings
required_status_checks:
  strict: true
  contexts:
    - "test"
    - "build (web)"
    - "build (android)"
enforce_admins: false
required_pull_request_reviews:
  required_approving_review_count: 1
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
```

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify workflow triggers on push and PR
- [ ] Test that failing tests block pipeline
- [ ] Validate code quality checks work
- [ ] Confirm multi-platform builds succeed
- [ ] Test caching improves build times

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow created and functional
- [ ] Automated testing runs on every commit
- [ ] Code quality checks enforce standards
- [ ] Multi-platform builds validate successfully
- [ ] CI pipeline completes in under 10 minutes
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] Pipeline tested with sample commits

## Dependencies
### Task Dependencies
- **Before**: task-1.1.1-initialize-flutter-project, task-1.1.2-configure-development-environment
- **After**: All subsequent development tasks benefit from CI/CD

### External Dependencies
- **Services**: GitHub repository access, GitHub Actions
- **Infrastructure**: Flutter SDK, platform build tools

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: CI pipeline too slow affecting development velocity
- **Mitigation**: Implement aggressive caching and optimize build steps

- **Risk**: Platform-specific build failures
- **Mitigation**: Test builds locally before committing, use stable Flutter versions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow functional
- [ ] Automated testing integrated
- [ ] Code quality checks active
- [ ] Multi-platform build validation working
- [ ] CI pipeline performance optimized
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured
