# Task 1.1.1: Initialize Flutter Project

## Task Overview
- **User Story**: us-1.1-project-setup
- **Task ID**: task-1.1.1-initialize-flutter-project
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Estimated Effort**: 4 hours
- **Dependencies**: None

## Description
Create a new Flutter project with proper configuration, directory structure, and initial setup for the Snakes Fight multiplayer game. This establishes the foundational structure for all subsequent development.

## Technical Requirements
### Architecture Components
- **Frontend**: Flutter application structure
- **Backend**: None (foundational setup)
- **Database**: None (foundational setup)
- **Integration**: Development environment setup

### Technology Stack
- **Language/Framework**: Flutter 3.x, Dart 3.x
- **Dependencies**: Initial Flutter dependencies
- **Tools**: Flutter CLI, VS Code/Android Studio

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Flutter Project
- **Action**: Initialize new Flutter project using CLI with proper name and organization
- **Deliverable**: Basic Flutter project structure
- **Acceptance**: Project compiles without errors
- **Files**: All Flutter project files in root directory

### Step 2: Configure Project Structure
- **Action**: Set up recommended folder structure for scalable Flutter app
- **Deliverable**: Organized lib/ directory with feature-based structure
- **Acceptance**: Clear separation of concerns in folder structure
- **Files**: lib/core/, lib/features/, lib/shared/ directories

### Step 3: Setup Development Configuration
- **Action**: Configure analysis_options.yaml, pubspec.yaml, and development settings
- **Deliverable**: Development configuration files
- **Acceptance**: Proper linting and code formatting rules active
- **Files**: analysis_options.yaml, pubspec.yaml updates

### Step 4: Initialize Version Control
- **Action**: Set up Git repository with appropriate .gitignore
- **Deliverable**: Git repository with initial commit
- **Acceptance**: Repository tracks only necessary files
- **Files**: .gitignore, README.md updates

    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^3.0.0
```

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for project structure validation
- [ ] Integration tests for app initialization
- [ ] Build tests for different platforms (web, mobile)
- [ ] Development environment tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Flutter project created successfully
- [x] Project compiles without errors on all target platforms
- [x] Folder structure follows Flutter best practices
- [x] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- [x] All implementation steps completed
- [x] Development environment configured
- [x] Hot reload functionality working

## Dependencies
### Task Dependencies
- **Before**: None (foundational task)
- **After**: All other Phase 1 tasks depend on this completion

### External Dependencies
- **Services**: Flutter SDK installation
- **Infrastructure**: Development environment (VS Code/Android Studio)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Flutter SDK version compatibility issues
- **Mitigation**: Use stable Flutter channel and document version requirements

- **Risk**: Platform-specific build issues
- **Mitigation**: Test builds on all target platforms early

## Definition of Done
- [x] All implementation steps completed
- [x] Project structure follows Flutter conventions
- [x] Code compiles successfully on web and mobile
- [x] Hot reload working properly
- [x] Git repository properly initialized
- [x] Documentation updated with setup instructions
- [x] Development environment validated
