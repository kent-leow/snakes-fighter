# Task 1.2.4: Create Complete Game Loop

## Task Overview
- **User Story**: us-1.2-core-game-engine
- **Task ID**: task-1.2.4-create-complete-game-loop
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Estimated Effort**: 12 hours
- **Dependencies**: task-1.2.1-implement-snake-movement-system, task-1.2.2-implement-food-system, task-1.2.3-implement-collision-detection-system

## Description
Integrate all game systems into a cohesive single-player game loop with proper state management, game lifecycle, and performance optimization. This creates a complete playable single-player snake game.

## Technical Requirements
### Architecture Components
- **Frontend**: Game loop controller, state management, lifecycle management
- **Backend**: None (local game logic)
- **Database**: None (local state)
- **Integration**: Integration of all game systems

### Technology Stack
- **Language/Framework**: Flutter/Dart, Ticker for game loop
- **Dependencies**: Flutter animation framework
- **Tools**: Performance profiling tools

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Game State Management
- **Action**: Implement comprehensive game state system with all game states
- **Deliverable**: Game state manager handling all game lifecycle states
- **Acceptance**: Proper state transitions and state-specific behavior
- **Files**: lib/features/game/controllers/game_state_manager.dart

### Step 2: Implement Main Game Controller
- **Action**: Create central game controller integrating all game systems
- **Deliverable**: Master game controller coordinating all subsystems
- **Acceptance**: All game systems work together seamlessly
- **Files**: lib/features/game/controllers/game_controller.dart

### Step 3: Setup Game Loop with Ticker
- **Action**: Implement efficient game loop using Flutter's Ticker
- **Deliverable**: Consistent 60fps game loop with proper timing
- **Acceptance**: Stable frame rate and timing across all platforms
- **Files**: lib/features/game/controllers/game_loop.dart

### Step 4: Implement Game Lifecycle Management
- **Action**: Handle game start, pause, resume, restart, and end scenarios
- **Deliverable**: Complete game lifecycle with proper cleanup
- **Acceptance**: Smooth transitions between all game states
- **Files**: lib/features/game/controllers/lifecycle_manager.dart

### Step 5: Add Performance Optimization
- **Action**: Optimize game loop performance and memory usage
- **Deliverable**: Optimized game performance meeting requirements
- **Acceptance**: 60fps on target devices, <100MB memory usage
- **Files**: lib/core/utils/performance_monitor.dart

## Technical Specifications
### Game States
```dart
enum GameState {
  menu,
  playing,
  paused,
  gameOver,
  restarting
}

class GameStateManager {
  GameState currentState;
  
  void transitionTo(GameState newState);
  bool canTransitionTo(GameState newState);
  void handleStateChange(GameState from, GameState to);
}
```

### Game Controller
```dart
class GameController {
  final Snake snake;
  final List<Food> foods;
  final CollisionManager collisionManager;
  final GameStateManager stateManager;
  
  void startGame();
  void pauseGame();
  void resumeGame();
  void restartGame();
  void endGame();
  void update(double deltaTime);
}
```

### Game Loop
```dart
class GameLoop extends TickerProvider {
  late Ticker ticker;
  final GameController gameController;
  
  void start();
  void stop();
  void pause();
  void resume();
  void _tick(Duration elapsed);
}
```

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for game state management
- [ ] Unit tests for game controller integration
- [ ] Performance tests for game loop timing
- [ ] Integration tests for complete game lifecycle
- [ ] Memory usage tests
- [ ] Frame rate consistency tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete single-player snake game functional
- [ ] Game runs at consistent 60fps
- [ ] All game systems integrated and working together
- [ ] Proper game state management and transitions
- [ ] Memory usage under 100MB on mobile devices
- [ ] Game lifecycle handles all scenarios (start, pause, restart, end)
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] Performance requirements met

## Dependencies
### Task Dependencies
- **Before**: task-1.2.1-implement-snake-movement-system, task-1.2.2-implement-food-system, task-1.2.3-implement-collision-detection-system
- **After**: task-1.3.1-create-game-canvas, multiplayer integration in later phases

### External Dependencies
- **Services**: Flutter animation framework
- **Infrastructure**: All previous game system implementations

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Frame rate drops on lower-end devices
- **Mitigation**: Implement performance monitoring and optimization strategies

- **Risk**: Memory leaks in game loop
- **Mitigation**: Proper cleanup and disposal patterns, memory profiling
