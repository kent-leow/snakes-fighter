# Task 2.1.2: Firebase Security Rules Configuration

## Overview
- User Story: us-2.1-firebase-configuration
- Task ID: task-2.1.2-security-rules-config
- Priority: High
- Effort: 6 hours
- Dependencies: task-2.1.1-firebase-project-setup

## Description
Configure Firebase Realtime Database security rules to ensure proper access control while enabling real-time multiplayer functionality. Implement rules that allow authenticated users to read/write game data while preventing unauthorized access.

## Technical Requirements
### Components
- Firebase Realtime Database: Security rules engine
- Firebase Authentication: User verification
- Rule Testing: Firebase console simulator

### Tech Stack
- Firebase Security Rules: JSON-based rules language
- Firebase CLI: For rules deployment
- Firebase Console: For testing and validation

## Implementation Steps
### Step 1: Design Security Rules Structure
- Action: Plan data access patterns and security requirements
- Deliverable: Security rules design document
- Acceptance: Rules design covers all data access scenarios
- Files: Security rules documentation

### Step 2: Implement Database Security Rules
- Action: Write security rules for rooms, players, and game state
- Deliverable: Complete security rules configuration
- Acceptance: Rules validate correct access patterns
- Files: `database.rules.json`

### Step 3: Test Security Rules
- Action: Test rules using Firebase console simulator
- Deliverable: Validated security rules
- Acceptance: All test scenarios pass
- Files: Test cases documentation

### Step 4: Deploy and Validate Production Rules
- Action: Deploy rules to Firebase and verify in live environment
- Deliverable: Production-ready security rules
- Acceptance: Rules work correctly with actual authentication
- Files: Deployment verification checklist

## Technical Specs
### Database Security Rules
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "rooms": {
      "$roomId": {
        ".read": "auth != null && (data.child('players').child(auth.uid).exists() || !data.exists())",
        ".write": "auth != null",
        "players": {
          "$playerId": {
            ".write": "auth != null && $playerId == auth.uid"
          }
        },
        "gameState": {
          ".write": "auth != null && data.parent().child('players').child(auth.uid).exists()"
        }
      }
    },
    "users": {
      "$userId": {
        ".read": "auth != null && $userId == auth.uid",
        ".write": "auth != null && $userId == auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for security rules validation
- [ ] Integration tests with authentication scenarios
- [ ] Penetration testing for unauthorized access attempts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Security rules prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Authenticated users can access appropriate data
- [ ] Rules support real-time multiplayer data patterns
- [ ] Rules tested and validated in Firebase console
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Security audit documentation complete

## Dependencies
- Before: Firebase project setup complete
- After: Authentication system can use secure database
- External: Firebase Authentication service

## Risks
- Risk: Overly restrictive rules breaking functionality
- Mitigation: Comprehensive testing with various user scenarios

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Security rules implemented and tested
- [ ] Rules deployed to production
- [ ] Access patterns validated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
